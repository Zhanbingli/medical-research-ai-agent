## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- ♻️ Simplified codebase to a lightweight core: PubMed client + Multi-AI analyzer
- 📦 Trimmed dependencies to runtime essentials only
- 🧹 Removed unused multi-source search, caching/cost tracking layers, and advanced agent UI
- 🗒️ Dropped obsolete docs/tests tied to removed features

### Breaking Changes
- Cache/cost tracking modules, multi-source clients, and agent APIs were removed; use the streamlined `app.py` flow.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- 🎯 **Token counting and cost tracking**: Accurate token usage tracking for all AI providers
- 🗄️ **Enhanced caching system**: Size limits, LRU eviction, automatic cleanup
- ⚙️ **Configuration management**: Centralized config with validation (`src/utils/config.py`)
- 📝 **Advanced logging**: Colored console output, file rotation (`src/utils/logger.py`)
- 🔄 **Retry mechanisms**: Exponential backoff for PubMed and AI API calls
- 📊 **Cache statistics**: Hit/miss rates and detailed cache metrics
- ⏱️ **Rate limiting**: NCBI-compliant rate limiting for PubMed API

### Changed
- 📦 **Updated dependencies**: Latest stable versions of all packages
- 🔧 **AIClientManager**: Now returns `AIResponse` objects with metadata
- 💾 **PubMedClient**: Integrated caching support in `search_and_fetch()`
- 📋 **CacheManager**: Added size limits and better error handling

### Improved
- 🚀 **Performance**: Cache hit responses are 1000x+ faster
- 💰 **Cost accuracy**: Token counting from estimates to exact values
- 🛡️ **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- 📈 **Observability**: Detailed logs and statistics for debugging

### Fixed
- 🐛 Cache growing indefinitely (added size limits)
- 🐛 Missing token counts in cost tracking
- 🐛 Uncaught exceptions in AI client calls
- 🐛 No validation of environment variables

### Developer Experience
- 📚 Added comprehensive `OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`
- 🧪 Added testing dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov)
- 🎨 Added code quality tools (black, flake8, mypy)
- 📖 Improved code documentation and type hints

### Breaking Changes
None - This release is **fully backward compatible**

### Migration Guide
No migration required. All existing code will work without changes.

Optional improvements:
```python
# Use new metadata API (optional)
ai_response = ai_manager.generate_with_metadata(prompt)
print(f"Tokens used: {ai_response.total_tokens}")

# Use new config system (optional)
from src.utils.config import get_config
config = get_config()
```
